=============

		Rat Basketball is currently an exhibit at the Science Museum of Virginia. The exhibits main focus is psychology, but this purpose has been buried. To make it more of an engaging, rather than a spectator experience, we prototyped a game focusing on classical  conditioning practices 		 		The user would shoot from the  platform. As the ball goes through the net, it triggers a photocell resistor that is plugged into an Arduino and changes the state of the 7 segment LED  (scoreboard). Once the LED reaches 9 a buzzer and servo are triggered that dispenses a gum ball out of the hole in the front and resets back to 0,  reinforcing the psychology principles.
